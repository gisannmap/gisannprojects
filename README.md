### Projects Undertaken  
This repository contains various projects I have undertaken so far, along with their corresponding short documents and visualizations.  
 **Object Detection Using DOTA Dataset & YOLOv8** (2025)  
- Detected airplanes in aerial images using the **DOTA dataset** and **YOLOv8s model**.  
- Converted a subset of DOTA from **oriented bounding box (OBB)** format to **COCO format** for YOLOv8 compatibility.  
- Trained the YOLOv8 model with **preprocessing, augmentation, and validation** steps to enhance performance.  
- Built an **interactive Python-based interface** to visualize detection outputs.  
 **[View Project Presentation (YOLO)](project_docs/YOLOPPT.pdf)**  

 **Human-Elephant Conflict & Forest Fire Risk Assessment** (2022) 
- Applied **Frequency Ratio** & **Weighted Overlay** GIS modeling.  
- Studied **vulnerability patterns** in the **Muthanga Wildlife Range, Kerala**.  
**[View Project Presentation](project_docs/HECPPT.pdf)**

 **Kerala Landslide & Rainfall Trends Visualization** (2024)  
- Developed an **interactive map** of Kerala using **Folium**.  
- Integrated **GeoJSON** for district boundaries.  
- Visualized **rainfall trends** and **landslide severity** using **Matplotlib**.

**Land Use Change Detection – Norcia, Italy** (2023–2024)  
- Analyzed **pre- and post-earthquake** land-use patterns after the 2016 Italy earthquake.  
- Applied **remote sensing** and **GIS techniques** for classification.
